"Over the past few years, the global oil landscape has entered one of its most complex and uncertain phases since the shocks of the 1970s. Demand is still rising in aggregate, especially in emerging Asia, yet the longer-term trajectory is clouded by rapid advances in clean energy, electric vehicles, and efficiency policies. Major producers are carefully managing supply to prevent price collapses, while geopolitical tensions and wars continue to disrupt traditional trade flows. At the same time, more than two trillion dollars a year is now being invested in the low-carbon energy transition, suggesting that oil’s dominance is gradually being eroded, even if it remains central to the global economy for decades to come.

According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), global oil consumption reached roughly 103–104 million barrels per day (mb/d) in 2024 and is projected to approach about 104–105 mb/d in 2025, with growth of around 0.7–1.1 mb/d per year depending on the scenario. [oai_citation:1‡IEA](https://www.iea.org/reports/oil-market-report-december-2024?utm_source=chatgpt.com) Most of this incremental demand comes from non-OECD economies, particularly in Asia, where rising incomes and industrial activity continue to increase use of petrochemical feedstocks, diesel, and jet fuel. By contrast, demand in many advanced economies is flattening or even declining as electric vehicles gain share, fuel efficiency standards tighten, and teleworking, public transit, and urban planning gradually reduce oil use in transport. [oai_citation:2‡IEA](https://www.iea.org/reports/oil-2024?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n\nThe medium- to long-term outlook for oil demand has become increasingly polarised between different institutions and scenarios. The IEA’s recent analyses suggest that, under an accelerated transition with strong climate policies, global oil demand would peak before 2030 and then gradually decline, plateauing around 105–106 mb/d before falling, as electric cars, heat pumps, and renewables displace oil in transport and power. [oai_citation:3‡一般財団法人 日本エネルギー経済研究所 - IEEJ](https://eneken.ieej.or.jp/data/11938.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com) In contrast, under a “current policies” world where governments do not significantly strengthen climate action, the IEA recently acknowledged that demand could continue to grow toward mid-century, potentially reaching about 113 mb/d by 2050—still higher than today, although far below the levels once imagined by the industry. [oai_citation:4‡Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/boards-policy-regulation/world-oil-gas-demand-could-grow-until-2050-iea-says-2025-11-12/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) Meanwhile, OPEC’s own outlooks remain more bullish, projecting that oil demand will keep increasing well past 2030, especially in Asia, Africa, and the Middle East. This divergence in demand expectations is central to strategic decisions facing governments, companies, and investors.\n\nOn the supply side, the most visible story has been OPEC+’s attempt to manage the market through a complex web of production cuts. As of mid-2025, the group—comprising OPEC members and allied producers such as Russia—has in place multiple layers of cuts totaling about 5.3 mb/d, roughly 5% of global demand. [oai_citation:5‡Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/what-opec-oil-output-cuts-are-currently-place-2024-12-05/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) These include a core cut of around 2 mb/d extended to 2026, additional voluntary reductions of 1.65 mb/d by key producers, and a separate 2.2 mb/d voluntary cut that began to be gradually unwound in 2025. The goal has been to counteract robust growth in non-OPEC supply, particularly from U.S. shale, Brazil, Guyana, and other emerging producers, and to prevent prices from slumping amid signs that demand growth is slowing.\n\nYet the world may be heading toward a period of structural oversupply. The IEA warns that global oil production capacity could reach nearly 114 mb/d by 2030 even as demand flattens at around 105.6 mb/d, implying a surplus of up to 8 mb/d if all planned projects move forward. [oai_citation:6‡Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/oil-demand-set-peak-by-2029-major-supply-glut-looms-iea-says-2025-11-06/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) In an even more pessimistic scenario for producers, the agency has indicated that by 2026 the market could see a glut of about 4 mb/d, putting downward pressure on prices and squeezing high-cost or heavily indebted producers. [oai_citation:7‡The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/nov/13/oversupply-oil-barrels-energy-watchdog-iea?utm_source=chatgpt.com) This looming mismatch between supply capacity and plausible demand is prompting some investors and companies to reconsider long-term oil expansion projects, even as short-term profitability remains attractive when prices are elevated.\n\nGeopolitics continue to shape the oil market in profound ways. The Russia–Ukraine war, which began in 2022, triggered one of the largest reconfigurations of energy trade flows in modern history. European Union sanctions and self-sanctioning by private companies slashed Europe’s imports of Russian crude and refined products; by 2025, Russian oil accounts for only a tiny fraction of EU imports, compared with around 30% before the war. [oai_citation:8‡Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/war-or-peace-oil-markets-ukraine-outcome-is-insignificant-2025-08-19/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) In response, Russia redirected much of its crude to India, China, and Turkey, often at steep discounts. Academic analyses suggest that the war and its associated sanctions were responsible for the majority of price volatility and the large spikes in Brent and WTI prices observed in 2022. [oai_citation:9‡IDEAS/RePEc](https://ideas.repec.org/a/pal/palcom/v11y2024i1d10.1057_s41599-023-02526-9.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n\nAs the conflict has dragged on, Ukraine has increasingly targeted Russian oil infrastructure with drone strikes, hitting numerous refineries and temporarily disrupting over a million barrels per day of refining capacity. [oai_citation:10‡Financial Times](https://www.ft.com/content/8f8caa82-0792-4d4e-b350-c484e024d725?utm_source=chatgpt.com) These attacks, coupled with international sanctions, have significantly reduced Russia’s oil export revenues; by late 2025, Russian budget income from oil exports is reported to be markedly lower than a year earlier, forcing Moscow to draw on reserves and cut other spending. [oai_citation:11‡United24 Media](https://united24media.com/war-in-ukraine/russias-oil-revenues-are-in-a-free-fall-down-25-billion-in-2025-crude-sells-for-half-price-13649?utm_source=chatgpt.com) At the same time, the global market has largely adjusted to these disruptions through higher exports from the Middle East, the United States, and other producers, while demand restraint from high prices and mild economic slowdowns has limited upward price pressure.\n\nMore recently, oil prices have been under downward pressure despite ongoing geopolitical risks. In late 2025, prices extended a multi-day decline as reports emerged of intensified diplomatic efforts—especially by the United States—to broker a pathway toward a Russia–Ukraine peace arrangement, which markets interpreted as potentially increasing future oil supply and reducing war-related risks. [oai_citation:12‡Hellenic Shipping News](https://www.hellenicshippingnews.com/oil-extends-decline-by-1-as-us-presses-for-russia-ukraine-peace-deal/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) At the same time, uncertainty about interest rates and global economic growth has weighed on traders’ risk appetite. The result has been a seesaw pattern: occasional price spikes after new supply disruptions or geopolitical shocks, followed by corrections as demand concerns or policy signals reassert themselves.\n\nOverlaying these cyclical and geopolitical factors is the structural force of the energy transition. Worldwide investment in low-carbon technologies—renewable power, electrified transport, energy storage, and grids—reached an estimated 2.1 trillion dollars in 2024, an 11% increase over the previous year. [oai_citation:13‡BloombergNEF](https://about.bnef.com/insights/finance/global-investment-in-the-energy-transition-exceeded-2-trillion-for-the-first-time-in-2024-according-to-bloombergnef-report/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) This shift in capital allocation is beginning to reshape the oil and gas sector from within. Many major oil companies now describe themselves as “integrated energy companies,” investing in wind, solar, hydrogen, biofuels, and carbon capture while gradually narrowing the share of spending on new long-lived oil projects. Analysts note that the transition is not simply about adding renewables on top of fossil fuels but about building an entirely new energy system that increasingly substitutes for them. [oai_citation:14‡KPMG](https://kpmg.com/kz/en/home/insights/2024/09/energy-transition.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n\nEven under ambitious transition scenarios, however, oil is not expected to disappear. Heavy industry, long-distance aviation, shipping, and petrochemicals all remain difficult to decarbonize, and oil will likely continue to play a role in these sectors for decades, albeit at a reduced and more specialized scale. [oai_citation:15‡KPMG](https://kpmg.com/kz/en/home/insights/2024/09/energy-transition.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com) In many developing countries, especially in South Asia and parts of Africa, rising populations and aspirations for higher living standards mean that demand for mobility and manufactured goods is still growing rapidly. Policymakers in these regions face the challenge of meeting legitimate development needs while avoiding long-term carbon lock-in, and they are increasingly seeking financial and technological support to leapfrog to cleaner systems.\n\nFor oil-exporting countries, the current situation is both an opportunity and a warning. On the one hand, relatively high prices and continued demand in the 2020s offer a window to generate revenue, diversify economies, and invest in human capital and infrastructure. On the other hand, the prospect of demand peaking before many of these economies have fully diversified raises serious questions about fiscal sustainability and political stability. The IEA’s warnings about potential oversupply and an 8 mb/d gap between capacity and demand by 2030 suggest that competition among producers could intensify, particularly if some choose to maximize output to defend market share rather than restrain production to support prices. [oai_citation:16‡Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/oil-demand-set-peak-by-2029-major-supply-glut-looms-iea-says-2025-11-06/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n\nConsumers and importing countries face a different set of trade-offs. In the short term, they benefit from stable or falling oil prices, which reduce inflationary pressures and ease burdens on households and businesses. However, prolonged periods of low prices can also slow investment in alternatives, delaying the clean-energy transition and leaving economies vulnerable to future supply shocks. Many governments are therefore trying to strike a delicate balance: phasing out inefficient fossil-fuel subsidies, using carbon pricing or regulations to maintain incentives for efficiency and electrification, and simultaneously ensuring that the remaining oil system remains reliable during the transition.\n\nUltimately, the current oil situation can be summarized as a race between two dynamics. On one side is the inertia of existing infrastructure, habits, and economic structures that still rely heavily on oil. On the other side is the accelerating progress of the energy transition, propelled by technological innovation, climate policy, and changing social expectations. In the near term, demand is still rising modestly and major producers are carefully calibrating output to keep prices within a profitable band. But looking further out, the combination of plateauing demand, rising non-OPEC supply, and surging investment in clean technologies points toward a world in which oil is no longer the unquestioned backbone of the energy system, but rather one important component of a more diversified, electrified, and low-carbon energy mix.\n\nHow smoothly this transition unfolds will depend on choices made today. If policymakers coordinate to give clear long-term signals, support vulnerable populations and regions, and manage geopolitical risks, the world could move from oil dependence to a more sustainable energy system without severe economic or social disruption. If, instead, decisions are delayed and signals remain contradictory—encouraging both large new oil investments and rapid decarbonization simultaneously—the coming decades could be marked by cycles of boom and bust, stranded assets, and heightened geopolitical frictions. In either case, oil will remain a central, if gradually diminishing, force in global politics and economics for many years to come."
